Replication of the above paper as a machine learning class ter project

Summary:
Localization of referential expressions in an image 

Abstract:
Generally, when we are talking about some people or some object, we refer them accordingly their relationship
with the other objects or people. However, if we, as a human, understand objects or people with these
relationships, then computers also must be able to understand this way so that we can have more accurate
results. In this paper, I use Computational Modular Networks (CMNs) which first parses the referential
expression as entities and relations,then identifies in the image and finds the most related one.
